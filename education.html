                animals in a healthy environment. These three helps to keep the entire eco system healthy 
                and alive for many years together. It is due to excessive air pollution and global warming

               off in the dustbin. This will prevent any air pollution accumulated on burning these products. You can 
               also use reusable towels and reusable bags rather than using disposable plastics or bags.</p>

            <h2>Reduce carbon footprints</h2>

                use of air conditioner or heater and buy energy efficient lights to lower the energy consumption and heat 
                generation level.</p>

            <p>Planting of the food locally helps in reducing the overall commercial transportation of food items that 
               require pesticides and preservatives to preserve them. These preservatives directly pollute the air. 
               It is also a proven facts that organic food is more sustainable that the one which is preserved using 
               harmful pesticides and chemicals, thereby casing harm to the entire global ecosystem.</p>

               to dispose off biodegradable as well as non-biodegradable wastes in a proper way and avoid littering
